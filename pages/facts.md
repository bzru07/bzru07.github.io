Data types in Python are used to determine what kind of value a variable holds in a program. This helps to determine what operations can be performed with these variables. Some of the most basic and commonly used built-in data types are explained below:

### String
- Used for a sequence of characters: letters, numbers, or symbols.
- Represents text.
- In Python, written between quotation marks (`" "` or `' '`).
- **Example**: `"This is an example of a string!"`

### Integer
- Whole numbers that can be positive or negative.
- Used for mathematical operations, stored as numeric data.
- **Example**: `5`

### Float
- Decimal numbers.
- Used when working with fractions or more precise measurements.
- **Example**: `7.898976`

### Boolean
- A value that is always `True` or `False`.
- Represents logical statements.
- **Example**: `is_snowing = True`

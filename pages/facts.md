Data types in Python are used to determine what kind of value a variable holds in a program. This helps to determine what kind
of operations can be performed with these variables. Some of the most basic and used built in data types are explained below. 

String 
- Used for a sequence of characters - letters, numbers, symbols
- Represent text 
- In python, written in between quotation marks - " "
Example:
"This is an example of a string!"

Integer 
- Whole number that can be positive or negative
- Used for mathematical operations - stored as numeric data
Examples: 5,10,11

Float 
- Decimal numbers
- Used when working with fractions or more precise measurements
